> **5.9 describe the trend in boiling point and viscosity of the main

> **Viscosity:** Viscosity refers to the less ease of flow of a liquid.
> If the number of carbon increases, the attraction between the
> hydrocarbon molecules also increases which results the liquid become
> more viscous with the increasing length of the chain of hydrocarbon.
> The liquid flow less easily with the increasing molecular mass. That
> means the hydrocarbons become more viscous.
>
> **Melting point/ Boiling point:** As the molecules get larger, the
> intermolecular attraction becomes greater. So more heat is needed to
> separate the molecules which results increasing the molecular size,
> increases the boiling point.
>
> **Volatility:** Volatility means the state of changing physical state.
> With the increasing molecular size, the hydrocarbon liquids become
> less volatile. As the attraction between the molecules increases with
> the increasing molecular size.
>
> **Flambility:** The small hydrocarbons burn easily. So, the bigger the
> size, the less flammable the hydrocarbons are.
>
> **Summary:**\
> As the molecules get bigger, the following changes occur:
