> **4.22 understand that some reactions are reversible and are indicated

> E.g.:
>
> *N2 + 3H2*⇌ _2NH3_\
> When nitrogen and hydrogen react, it produces ammonia. This is forward
> reaction.

*N2 + 3H2* _2NH3_(forward reaction)

> The produced ammonia can be decomposed to give nitrogen and hydrogen.
> This is backward reaction.
>
> *2NH3* _N2 + 3H2_ (backward reaction)\

> **Heating copper(II) sulphate crystals**\
> If you heat blue copper(II) sulphate gently, the blue crystals turn to
> a white powder and water is driven off. Heating causes the crystals to
> lose their water of crystallisation and white anhydrous copper(II)
> sulphate is formed.

> _CuSO4 . 5H2O(s)_  _CuSO4(s) + 5H2O(l)_ Now if you add water to the
> white solid, it will turn blue and will get warm.
>
> _CuSO4(s) + 5H2O(l)_  _CuSO4 . 5H2O(s)_\
> **Heating ammonium chloride**\
> If you heat ammonium chloride, the white crystals disappear from the
> bottom of the tube and reappear further up.
