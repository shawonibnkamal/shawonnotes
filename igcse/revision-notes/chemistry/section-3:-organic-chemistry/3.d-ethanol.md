> **3.10 describe the manufacture of ethanol by the fermentation of
> sugars, for example glucose, at a temperature of about 30°C**\
> Fermentation is a chemical process in which microorganisms such as
> yeast act on carbohydrates to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide.
> Sugars and starch are examples of carbohydrates.
>
> Yeast contains zymase enzymes (biological catalysts) which cause
> starch or sugar to break down to glucose. The glucose is then broken
> down to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
>
> A glucose solution is mixed with yeast and the mixture is produced
> after a few days.
>
> The enzymes in yeast work best at around 37oC. If the temperature is
> raised beyond 37o, the enzymes will die and the fermentation stops.
>
> The fermentation of sugars produces only a dilute solution of ethanol
> which is about 12%.This is because when the alcohol content exceeds
> this value, the yeast dies and fermentation stops. Then the fermented
> mixture is filtered to remove the solid impurities and the filtrate is
> fractionally distilled for further purification.

> **Other reactions of alcohol:**\
> **(i) With sodium**\
> Ethanol reacts with sodium to produce sodium ethoxide and hydrogen.
> This time, sodium sinks in ethanol, (whereas sodium floats in water).
>
> _C2H5OH + Na_  _C2H5ONa + H2_\
> **(ii) With phosphorus pentachloride**\
> Ethanol reacts with phosphorus (V) chloride to produce chloroethane,
> phosphorus oxychloride and steamy fumes of hydrogen chloride gas.
>
> *C2H5OH + PCl5* _C2H5Cl + POCl2 + HCl_ **(iii) With acidified

>
> If ethanol is warmed with acidify potassium dichloro VI, then, ethanol
