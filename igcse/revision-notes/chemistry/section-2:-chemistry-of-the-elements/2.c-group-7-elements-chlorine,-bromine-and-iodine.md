> **2.12 explain, in terms of dissociation, why hydrogen chloride is
> acidic in water but not in methylbenzene** In water, hydrogen chloride
> dissociates to form hydrogen ion. That's why it shows acidic property.
> This solution can react with metals to give H2 gas.
>
> This solution changes the colour of blue litmus paper to red. That
> means hydrogen chloride is an acid.
>
> Hydrogen chloride in methyl benzene, does not dissociates. It exists
> as molecule. So it cannot show acid behavior in methyl benzene. That's
> why this solution does not react with metal carbonates, metal
> sulphides, and cannot change the colour of litmus.

> **2.13 describe the relative reactivities of the elements in Group 7**
> The reactivity falls quickly as you go down the group.

> During the reactions, halogens gain one electron to form negatively
> charged ions. This is because the nucleus attracts the outer shell
> electron towards it to achieve to fill up its octet. If we go down the
> group, the distance between the nucleus and the outer shell electron
> increases. So the attraction for the extra electron decreases. So
> larger halogens feel less attraction for an extra electron.
