**2.5 understand that the noble gases (Group 0) are a family of inert
gases and explain their lack of reactivity**

> **in terms of their electronic configurations.**
>
> The noble gases are neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon. Helium have
> two electrons in their outer shell which is full
>
> and is called duplet electron configuration.

> **Physical properties of noble gases:**
>
> • Colorless gases
>
> • Monatomic: ie. They consist of only one atom
>
> • Densities and boiling points are in a trend. They increases if you

> **Chemical properties of noble gases:**
>
> • They do not react to form ions and so don't produce ionic compounds.

> • They are unlikely to form covalent compounds. Because it costs too

> levels to produce the single electron that an atom needs.
