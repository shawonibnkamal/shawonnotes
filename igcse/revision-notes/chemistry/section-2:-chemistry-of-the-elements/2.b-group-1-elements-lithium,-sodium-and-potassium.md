_2Na(s) + 2H2O(l)_  _2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)_

> The sodium floats on water because it is less dense. It melts because
> its melting point is low and a lot of heat is produced in this
> reaction. It forms a ball. Because the hydrogen isn't given off
> symmetrically around the ball, the sodium is pushed around the surface
> of the water.
>
> A white trail is formed inside the water which is sodium hydroxide,
> which dissolves to make a strongly alkaline solution. All these metals
> react with water to produce alkaline metal hydroxides. That's why the
> Group is called 'alkali metals'.
>
> **Lithium:**

_2Li (s) + 2H2O(l)_  _2LiOH(aq) + H2(g)_

> The reaction is very similar to sodium's reaction, except that it is
> slower. Lithium's melting point is higher and the heat isn't produced
> so quickly, so the lithium doesn't melt.
>
> **Potassium:**

_2K(s) +2H2O(l)_  _2KOH(aq) + H2 (g)_

> Potassium's reaction is faster than sodium's. Enough heat is produced
> to ignite the hydrogen, which burns with a lilac flame. The reaction
> often ends with the potassium spitting around.
>
> **Rubidium and caesium:**
>
> These react even more violently than potassium, and the reaction can
> be explosive. Rubidium hydroxide and caesium hydroxide are formed.
