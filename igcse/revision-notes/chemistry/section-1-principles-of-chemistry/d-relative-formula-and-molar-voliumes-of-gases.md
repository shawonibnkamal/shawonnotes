# d) Relative Formula Masses and Molar Volumes of Gases

## 1.16 Calculate Relative Formula Masses (Mr) from Relative Atomic Masses (Ar)

The total mass of the molecule calculated from the relative atomic masses of the atoms present in the compound is called relative formula mass.

Example:

- $H_2O = (1 \times 2) + 16 = 18$
- $(NH_4)_2CO_3 = ((2 + 1) \times 4) \times 2 + 12 + (16 \times 3) = 96$

## 1.17 Understand the Use of the Term Mole to Represent the Amount of Substance

A mole is a certain amount of substance. It is a general term to describe an amount of atoms, ions, or molecules.

## 1.18 Understand the Term Mole as the Avogadro Number of Particles (Atoms, Molecules, Formulae, Ions or Electrons) in a Substance

A mole is defined as the amount of substance which contains the Avogadro number of particles.

Avogadro Number = $6 \times 10^{23}$

## 1.19 Carry Out Mole Calculations Using Relative Atomic Mass (Ar) and Relative Formula Mass (Mr)

Mole = Number of Particles / $6 \times 10^{23}$

## 1.20 Understand the Term Molar Volume of a Gas and Use Its Values (24 dm3 and 24,000 cm3) at Room Temperature and Pressure (rtp) in Calculations

Volume of one mole of any gas is molar volume. It is 24dm3 or 24000 cm3 at R.T.P.
