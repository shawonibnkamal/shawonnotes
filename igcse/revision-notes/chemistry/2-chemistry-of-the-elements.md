> **_What is rusting?_**
>
> When an object made of iron is exposed to moist air for some time, a
> reddish-brown substance slowly forms on the surface of the metal. The
> substance is called rust and have the chemical name hydrated iron (II)
> oxide.
>
> The process is known as rusting or corrosion of iron.\
> 4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) + 2xH2O(l)  2Fe2O3xH2O(s)
>
> **Conditions under which iron rusts:**\
> • Both air and water are needed for rusting to occur\
> • The presence of sodium chloride increases the speed of rusting.
>
> **2.35 describe how the rusting of iron may be prevented by grease,
> oil, paint, plastic and galvanising** Grease, oil, paint and plastic
> prevent air and/or water from coming into contact with iron. This
> means the reaction that rusts iron can\'t occur.
>
> Galvanizing is coating in zinc. This Zinc react in the air to form
> ZnCO3 which prevents air and/or water from coming into contact with
> the iron.
>
> **2.36 understand the sacrificial protection of iron in terms of the
> reactivity series.**
>
> Magnesium or zinc is used as sacrificial protection of iron. If you
> keep them beside or attach them to iron, magnesium or zinc will
> corrode instead of iron. Because they are more reactive than iron. As
> long as magnesium or zinc is present, iron will not rust.
